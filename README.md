# Caesar Cipher

This is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting text. The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features

- **Encrypt Text**: Shifts each letter in the message by a specified number of positions to produce encrypted text.
- **Decrypt Text**: Shifts each letter in the encrypted message back to retrieve the original message.
- **User Input**: Allows users to input their message, choose a shift value, and specify whether they want to encrypt or decrypt.
